            <h1>Types of Sushi</h1>
            <br>
            <p>If the perfect food existed, sushi would be a strong contender. It’s healthy, it’s convenient, and there are unlimited flavor combinations to try. Sushi is also just as pleasing to look at as it is to eat. It’s no wonder sushi is one of the most popular international dishes in the world. If you’re interested in opening your own sushi restaurant or adding sushi to your current menu, keep reading to learn all about the different kinds of sushi.</p>

                <p>Technically, sashimi isn’t a type of sushi because it contains no rice. We're including it in our sushi guide because it plays an important role in Japanese cuisine. Sashimi is thinly sliced fish or meat, often served raw. It can be any type of meat, but fish and seafood are the most common types of sashimi. <br>

                    Sashimi can also be cooked, like in the case of unagi (grilled eel). It’s common to serve slices of sashimi on a bed of daikon radish with a side of Asian sauces like ponzu, soy sauce, or a soy sauce substitute. No other toppings or fillings are added because sashimi is meant to highlight the fresh flavors of the fish. <br>
                    
                    For any seafood that is served raw, it's important to source your fish from trusted suppliers. Learn more in our sushi-grade fish guide.</p>

                <h2>Sashimi vs Sushi</h2><br>
                <p>Sushi always contains rice, while sashimi is just slices of meat or fish. Sashimi could be considered “no-rice sushi.”</p><br>
                <h2>Different Sashimi Types</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Sake</b> - Raw salmon</li>
                    <li><b>Ebi</b> - Cooked shrimp</li>
                    <li><b>Ahi</b> - Raw tuna</li>

                <img src="Pictures/types/2. Nigiri Sushi (Nigirizushi).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Nigiri is a type of sushi that combines a pillow of vinegared rice with a topping of raw or cooked seafood. These two ingredients are all that’s needed to create a perfect match of flavors and textures. Nigiri sushi is considered a simplistic delicacy in Japan, a contrast to the complicated sushi rolls that are enjoyed here in the West.
            </div>
            <div class="type-info info">
                <h2>Nigiri vs Sushi</h2><br>
                <p>The difference between nigiri and sushi (maki) is that the rice in nigiri is pressed into a bite-sized mound, while maki sushi is rolled into a tube and sliced into rolls. Nigiri contains one piece of fish delicately placed on top, and maki rolls contain fillings on the inside.</p>
                <br>

                <img src="Pictures/types/1. Sashimi.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Maki sushi is made by layering a sheet of seaweed with vinegared rice and fillings. It’s firmly rolled into thin tubes and sliced into bite-sized pieces. When you look at a slice of maki sushi, you’ll see fillings on the inside, a coating of sticky rice, and a covering of thin seaweed paper (nori).</p>

                <h2>Maki Sushi Meaning</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In Japanese, maki means “to roll.” All sushi rolls that are wrapped in seaweed with fillings on the inside are considered maki sushi.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Maki Roll vs Hand Roll</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The difference between a maki roll and a hand roll (temaki) is that maki sushi is firmly rolled and sliced into several bite-sized pieces. A hand roll is loosely rolled into a tube or cone shape and meant to be eaten whole as an individual serving.</p><br>
                <h2>Types of Maki Rolls</h2>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hosomaki</b> - Any small maki roll with only one filling is considered hosomaki sushi</li>
                    <li><b>Kappa Maki</b> - This popular maki roll is made with seaweed, rice, and a cucumber filling.</li>
                    <li><b>Tekka Maki</b> - There are just three ingredients in tekka maki — seaweed, rice, and raw tuna.</li>
                    <li><b>Futomaki</b> - Futomaki means "fat roll" and this maki contains several fillings.</li>

                <img src="Pictures/types/4. Uramaki (Uramakizushi).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Uramaki sushi is rolled sushi with rice on the outside and nori on the inside. This “inside-out” roll was created in Los Angeles by a sushi chef who wanted to appeal to American customers. Machita Ichiro noticed that Americans weren’t fond of the seaweed wrapping on traditional maki sushi, so he hid the seaweed on the inside. <br>

                    Traditional maki is still preferred in Japan, and uramaki is the most popular type of sushi in the US. Many of the sushi rolls referred to as “Special Rolls” on a sushi menu are types of uramaki. It's common for uramaki to be sprinkled with sesame seeds that cling to the sticky rice.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>California Roll</b> - This popular roll contains a filling of crabmeat or imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber.</li>
                    <li><b>Rainbow Roll</b> - The rainbow roll is similar to a California roll, but with a topping of colorful slices of raw fish like tuna, salmon, and yellowtail.</li>
                    <li><b>Dragon Roll</b> - A dragon roll contains a filling of cucumber, grilled eel, and shrimp tempura with a topping of sliced avocado that resembles dragon scales.</li>
                    <li><b>Spicy Tuna Roll</b> - The spicy tuna in this roll is made by finely chopping raw tuna and mixing it with sriracha and sesame oil. It's finished off with a topping of spicy mayo.</li>

                <img src="Pictures/types/5. Temaki (Temakizushi).jpg" alt="">
                <p>Temaki sushi is a little different from the other types of sushi on our list. A temaki hand roll consists of a large seaweed cone stuffed with rice, fish, and other sushi fillings. Unlike maki rolls, temaki isn’t rolled with the precise method that produces uniform pieces of sushi. A temaki hand roll is a little more deconstructed and is meant to be eaten by hand as an individual serving.</p>

                <h2>What Is a Sushi Burrito?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The sushi burrito, also called a sushirrito, is a fusion of temaki sushi with the overstuffed burritos that have become so popular in the last decade. While a temaki roll can be held in one hand, a sushi burrito is much larger. Instead of a flour tortilla, sushirittos are wrapped in a large nori sheet and feature typical sushi fillings like rice, fish, and vegetables.</p>

                <p>Chirashi is a lesser-known type of sushi that features a bed of sushi rice covered with toppings. The word chirashi means scattered, and it refers to the toppings placed on the sushi rice. But don't be confused by the term. Neatness and precision play a part in "scattering" the toppings over this sushi dish.</p>

                <h2>Types of Chirashi</h2><br>
                <p>There are several variations of chirashi sushi, but two of the most popular come from Tokyo and Osaka in Japan.</p>
                <br>
               
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tokyo Style (Edomae Chirashi)</b> - This style of chirashi sushi contains a topping of raw seafood like tuna, salmon, scallops, and squid.</li>
                    <li><b>Osaka Style (Gomoku Chirashi)</b> - Gomoku chirashi sushi is made with cooked ingredients and has a highly decorative appearance. It's common to see lotus root and fish roe as toppings.</li>
